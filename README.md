# Wildlife-Vocalization-Classification-for-Conservation-Monitoring
Machine Learning Project

A project based on audio analysis and detection of birds in Audio clips

# About the Dataset

The dataset consists of 10 second audioclips
A portion of the audio clips consists of bird sounds, and the and the rest consists of other miscellanious sounds
Features are extracted from the Audio clips and processed to make it fit for the models presented

# The features consist of:
# Spectral_Centroid
# Spectral_Bandwidth
# Spectral_Contrast
# Spectral_Rolloff
# Chroma
# Spectral_Flatness
# Zero_Crossing_Rate
# HNR
The dataset has 4730 values and 11 columns
